# Fat-estimator-in-human-body
# Short Describtions
This project tends to estimate % of body fat in a human's body based on parameters such as weight, Hip size, chest size and many more.
# Steps are taken to addressing this problem
1. Load the data set into Pandas Data Frame.
2. Perform Explortory Data Analysis on the data.
3. After EDA, select the appropriate Machine Learning algorithm by fine tuning the hyperparameters.
4. Unpickle the model and integrate it with the UI which is made using Flask Web Framework.
